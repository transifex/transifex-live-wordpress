Translate your WordPress website or blog without the usual complex setups.

== Description ==

Transifex Live is a fun, new way to translate your WordPress site. There’s no need to create one language per post, insert language tags, or have multiple WordPress instances. Your site’s content is automatically detected and ready to be saved to the Transifex localization platform, where you can order professional translations or work with your existing translators.

When the translations are done, take them live with the click of a button. The next time someone visits your WordPress site, they’ll automatically see the latest content in their native language.

In order to use Transifex Live you will need to [sign up here for a FREE account](https://www.transifex.com/signup/?utm_source=wp-directory&utm_campaign=int-wp). This plugin also requires a Transifex Live API key. More information about how to obtain a key can be found in the [Transifex Live documentation](http://docs.transifex.com/developer/live/?utm_source=wp-directory&utm_campaign=int-wp).

Features

* Integrate Transifex Live into your WordPress site using your API key.
* Display language selector in top left, top right, bottom left, or bottom right corner of your site.
* Auto-detect the browser locale and translate the page.
* Automatically identify new strings when page content changes.
* Customize the language switcher by choosing your own color scheme.

== Installation ==

Automatic

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Transifex Live, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "Transifex Live" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you’re sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.

Manual

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

Upgrading

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
