=== Installation ===

== Automatic Installation ==

To do an automatic install of Transifex Live, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "Transifex Live" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. You can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you’re sure you want to install the plugin. Click "yes" and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.
After installation a new menu setting option will appear called 'Transifex Live'.  You will need to complete the admin form before the plugin will become active.

== Manual Installation ==

Manual installation involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.
After installation a new menu setting option will appear called 'Transifex Live'.  You will need to complete the admin form before the plugin will become active.

== Upgrading ==

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Plugin Translations ==

The WP-Translations project for plugin translations can be found [here](https://www.transifex.com/wp-translations/transifex-live/transifex-live/).

== Tips for developers ==

* The Transifex Live plugin uses Wordpress hooks to manipulate the links found in your website's content, so they always point to the appropriate language. If you use custom post types (or one of your plugins does) that emits the 'the_content' filter, our code might not be triggered.

For those cases, it is recommended to manually trigger our custom filter 'tx_link' before you return your content, as seen in the example below:

Ex. $updated_content = apply_filters('tx_link', $original_content);

* It is also recommended  to use [widgets](https://codex.wordpress.org/Widgets_API) in your theme instead of custom code, since this allows you to make your integration more future proof against incompatibilities with 3rd party modules.
